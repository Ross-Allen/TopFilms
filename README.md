# Top Films

Top Films is a mini-program that reads in a text file of the top 50 movies of all time and allows the user to search and display stats and data.

## IMPORTANT

Top Films includes some starter-code provided by Utah State University's computer science department to which I give credit. Major functionality code is my own work. 

## Running Top Films

Run main.cpp using FilmStats.cpp and Filmstats.h with prefered C++ IDE. topFilms.txt contains the values read in by the program which will need to be included in project folder. 


## Built With

* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - C++ IDE used.


## Authors

* **Utah State University** - *starter-code*
* **Ross Allen** - *Major functionality/displayment code*

## Acknowledgments

Again, some starter-code was provided by Utah State University's CS department for the purpose of this assignment.
